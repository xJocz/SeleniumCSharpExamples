# SeleniumCSharpExamples

This is a simple example to train and exercise my knowhow about the Selenium Webdriver Applying some functional test patterns to test an open and random website on the internet.
I'm trying to use DRY concepts creating my own framework called as "DSL" like a commom language inside my project and adding the PageObjects pattern to make my code clean to reuse.

This is the site that i'm testing "http://automationpractice.com/index.php", in the future i'll edit this readme file with more concepts and maybe with the test case.

I'll create more tests asap, but the firsts commits will be only to organize and initialize my project on github, thats all for now, thanks.

If you have any tip, please type for me.
